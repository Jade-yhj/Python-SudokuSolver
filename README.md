# Python-SudokuSolver

Sudoku is a popular game originated from the work of the 17th century Swiss mathematician, Leonard Euler. He suggested the idea of ‘Latin squares’, which consist of grids of equal dimensions in which every symbol occurs exactly once in every row and every column. This project presents a model that solves 9×9 sudoku. This model is embedded into Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python-Dash that allows users to solve 9×9 Sudoku.
